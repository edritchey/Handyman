# Handyman 
  Handyman is my attempt at adding a GUI to an existing open-source program called AutoHotkey. https://autohotkey.com/.
  
  Autohotkey is a free, open-source scripting language for Windows that allows users to easily create small to complex scripts for all kinds of tasks. Autohotkey gives you the freedom to automate any desktop task. Define hotkeys for the mouse and keyboard, remap keys or buttons and autocorrect-like replacements. Creating simple hotkeys has never been easier; you can do it in just a few lines or less!  And soon there will be a user interface to automate things visually.
  
  Beta testers will be welcomed and of course, anyone willing to do help with the project is free to do so. Please read the documentation/tutorials for GitHub to familiarize yourself with the workflow.
